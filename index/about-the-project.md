# About the project

## Emergence

I only got to know the Nginx server after Apache. And was pleasantly surprised by the configuration. Some time ago I dealt with the topic of splitting several domains with destinations via the VPN via a bundled server. I found a domain mapping/splitting in the Nginx newer version. From another widely used project ([Nginx proxy manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/), which is a very good project) I use a lot the creation of certificates (Lets encrypt). I started the project and have a lot to learn myself, to incorporate my own ideas and extensions. It is another building block for other projects that I am making available to others.

## Project name

The name of the project is an allusion to the fish that is "air" in an atypical environment for it. Nevertheless, the fish copes perfectly here. This is how I see the project with the Nginx server and the interacting components. The name also goes well with "Docker" a whale.

## Structure

In the classic sense, FlyingFish is a nginx manager. But the way the nginx server is combined with other services is different! The FlyingFish is structured in part service, which automates many processes through an internal database or API communication.
