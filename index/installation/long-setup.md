## Construction

FlyingFish is divided into containers by Docker. The advantage here is that updates can be imported quickly and that each service is separated and therefore secured.

You can find the [Docker installation here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/).

Run the installation like [quick setup](quick-setup.md).

## Env

The Env file contains the environment variables for the individual containers and is the most important file for starting FlyingFish. After installation, save the file well and remove it from the system if the system is not owned by only one user.

## Docker compose

The current docker compose file is maintained in the [GitHub under the "setup" ](https://github.com/stefanwerfling/flyingfish/tree/main/setup)folder for productive use.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Please do not use the docker compose file from the main folder. As this is used for the development of FlyingFish.
