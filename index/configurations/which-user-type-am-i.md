## Type 1, server is behind the router

It is usually the case that if there is a server behind the router, the router has to open the ports. This router can get a dynamic IP from the provider or has a fixed IP. According to what we find, some things still need to be done.

* **ports Fixed** setting on the router

## Type 2, server is online
