# Discussions Subdomains

I read in an article that Google finds it better if a page is not part of a subdomain. Which can contribute to a better ranking. This cannot now be substantiated with facts as to whether this is really the case. But I found the discussion about it interesting.

Let's think this through. A big company really shouldn't offer a site running under a subdomain that is part of a third party domain. In any case, in my opinion, this state of affairs paints the wrong picture. The first question that comes up would be, doesn't the company have enough money for a main domain?

This is an attitude that should be considered correct. However, this is only my opinion.

But now comes the big thing, I think subdomains are important and necessary. If a company offers internal services/portal. Which are not available to the public, then that's the way to go.

I could now create a subdomain under a Nextcloud is running. First of all, it would be an unknown service for third parties (bad people, I mean hackers). The domain would be unknown, since the service going through the reverse proxy cannot be resolved without the subdomain name.

## Benefits of a Subdomain

* So it's another hurdle and can be seen as a security feature.
* Subdomains are also easy to manage.
*   Recognition is easier for users by grouping the main domain.



## Conclusion

It's one thing when we present something important, something for the public. I would totally understand Google along the way. But we can't do without it in the future either.
